        <h2>A Traffic Jam</h2>
        <!-- Storytime paragraph, to set the scene -->
		<p>Several horns beep on the streets just outside of city center. 
            The sun shines on the listless cars, trucks, and SUVs as they attempt to creep forward on their quest 
            to get home, but progress is akin to a mirage. The foreward movement of the automobiles appears to be as fast as the paint drying on a
            on a freshly coated pickett fence. It's Friday, the sun won't be out for very long, and drivers are eager to get home
            and make the most of their ephemeral weekend. 
            <br><br> <!-- create space so its easier to read -->
            It appears that today will be just like any other commute home,
            long and slow. Traffic planners are left scratching their heads; The homes and businesses along the route are entrenched, make widening the roadway
            impossible. The city plans to add more infrastructure for trains and other public transportation that could run 
            underground, but it could be years before construction workers break ground. It seems there's nothing that can be done in the
            short term.
            <br><br> <!-- emphasis on last line -->

		<h2>The Humble Alternative</h2>
		<p>There are many forms of alternate transportation outside of your typical privately owned automobile. Bicycles are an economical way
            to get around, they emit no emissions, are quiet, and are a great way to get exercise. Walking is great too! There 
            are also public transportation options that can be a consideration, such as buses, trains, and subways. However,
            these modes of transportation all have their drawbacks, particularly in the country I currently live in, the United States. 
            Bicycles are a great way to get from A-to-B much faster than walking, and don't require fuel to operate. 
            But, they aren't allowed on all motorways, and in many places, the infrastructure is not currently set up to support them. 
            <br><br> <!-- create space so its easier to read -->
            An electric bicycle is a powered, economical option, but are limited in their top speeds between 20 and 28 miles per hour,
            making them unsuitable for many American roadways and commutes. Parking them at your destination is also a concern, as many
            places do not have the infrastructure to safely lock or store many bicycles, and bicycles are among the easiest to steal. 
            Public transportation is a great option, but with the advent of COVID-19, many people may be wary of using public transportation, 
            public transportation may not be available at all in that particular area the person lives to where they work, 
            or they much prefer to travel solo or in small groups with private transportation. Also, for many people, driving a car, 
            even with traffic jams, is the fastest, most consistent way to get to work and school. However, there is one private transportation
            option that is often overlooked, which is more practical than a bicycle, can travel in and out of town, 
            can be more reliable than public transportation, and is more economical than a car. That option is the motor scooter.

		<h2>Dissolving Traffic</h2>
		<p>If people are riding scooters to work, wouldn't they be stuck in traffic, too?
            <!-- create space for dramatic effect -->
            <br><br>
            Ah, yes. The traffic. One might believe that scooters would be stuck, just like everyone else. And you'd be right, if only a driver or two 
            switched to commuting by scooter. However, the effect of switching to scooters becomes much more evident as the number of scooter commuters increases. In an
            article by <a href="https://newatlas.com/author/mike-hanlon/">Mike Hanlon</a> of New Atlas, 
            <a href="https://newatlas.com/motorcycles-reduce-congestion/21420/">he mentions a study presented at the Association des Constructeurs Europ√©ens de Motocycles (ACEM) 2012 Conference</a>,
            and within that study the data is as follows. If 10% of drivers switched to motorcycles/scooters, traffic would be reduced by 40%. If 25% of drivers switched, traffic would be reduced by 60%, eliminating 
            traffic congestion entirely.
            <br><br> <!-- create space for dramatic effect -->
            Wow.
            <br><br> <!-- create space for dramatic effect -->
            But why is this the case? And why not ride a motorcycle instead of a scooter?

        <h2>Efficient People Movers</h2>
        <!-- Paragraph for describing the inefficiency of automobiles for commuting -->
        <p>
            The average american is somewhere between 5'3" and 5'9" tall, and weighs somewhere between 171 and 200 pounds, according to the 
            <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm">CDC</a>. I don't know about you, but it seems that using 
            a 4000 pound box to move the weight a single 200 pound person around, is never going to be efficient. The majority of the time, in a typical 5 passenger vehicle, 
            only one of the seats is ever being used, and the trunk or cargo areas are typically empty until the weekend or after work. 
            The vehicle is almost never at capacity, yet is using nearly the same amount of fuel as if it were. 
            Not to mention, since the vehicle is mostly unoccupied, it takes up a lot of space on the road.
            <br><br> <!-- create space for dramatic effect -->
            Ah yes, space.
            <br><br> <!-- create space for dramatic effect -->
            A car takes up a lot of space. Like, A LOT of space for how many people it moves. And they keep on getting bigger and bigger. A quick look at the 
            average truck sold in 2023 and you'll see that they are absolutely gargantuan. Along with SUVs, they take up more space than ever. And they are 
            becoming more and more popular. So much so, that American automakers, such as Ford, have phased out their sedan models altogether. This is making
            traffic worse and worse, as more and more space is taken up by a single driver. Motorcycles and scooters can ride side by side, and you can fit 4 or 
            more in the same effective space as a single Truck or SUV sold today. They're so space efficient for the amount of people they move, 
            that they're legally allowed to drive inbetween the lanes of traffic at stop lights and in traffic jams in some jurisdictions in the USA, and many more
            around the world. 
            This maneuver is called "lane filtering", and is a major player in the reduction of traffic congestion. A scooter
            or motorcycle that can filter through stopped traffic can get to the front of the line, and be out of the way, while the cars are still waiting for 
            the traffic to begin to move can take up the space that would normally be occupied by a motorbike. A win-win for everyone involved.
            <br><br> <!-- create space to separate thoughts -->
            However, most of the USA does not allow lane filtering. Even with this in mind, scooters and motorcycles are still more space efficient than cars,
            and can still reduce traffic congestion, even without lane filtering, since 4 riders can fit in the same space as a single car. Reducing traffic
            improves urban mobility for everyone. Not to mention, scooters and motorcycles are much easier to park, and can park in places that cars cannot.
            As a result, two-wheeled commuters also free up more places for car commuters to park, since they can occupy spaces that cars would not fit. In the 
            two vehicle parking pad at my old internship, we could fit 12 bikes in the place of two full sized pickup trucks!

        <!-- Heading for describing the moped -->
        <h2>Wait, aren't scooters much slower than cars? I thought they were called Mopeds?</h2>
        <p>
            Ah yes, the moped. In the United States, there's some strange definitions when it comes to scooters and mopeds. A moped is actually a motorized pedalcycle,
            often a bike that has pedals, and can be either ridden entirely off of motor power, or propelled like a normal bicycle. 
            A scooter like the ones pictured previously are actually a two-wheeled motorcycles with a step-through 
            frame and a floorboard for the rider's feet. Not to be confused with a kick-scooter or electric kick-scooter, like this one here:

            <p>A standard kick scooter</p> <!-- Image description -->
            <br><br> <!-- create space for dramatic effect -->
            But why do some people call them mopeds then?
            <br><br> <!-- create space for dramatic effect -->
            Laws! In the United States, for road legality, a moped in most jurisdictions is often defined as a two-wheeled vehicle with a top speed of 30mph or less, 
            and an engine displacement of 50 cubic centimeters (50cc) or less. It is classified as a moped, regardless of whether it has pedals or not. The smallest engined of scooters, 
            the 50cc class, fall under this registration distinction. So, in the United States, a 50cc scooter is often called a moped, and since they can often 
            share the same frame, or designs, as larger scooters that are registered as motorcycles, they are often lumped together with a catch-all term of "moped".

        <!-- Header of confusion, why a scooter? -->
        <h2>Uhhh, so how are they supposed to replace commuter cars if they can't go faster than an electric bike? Why not buy a motorcycle?</h2>
        <!-- paragraph explaining speed and practicality of options -->
        <p>
            Confusing, right? Well, you see, that's where the more useful, much more practical class of scooters enter the fray. The 125cc class of scooters and 
            larger, are where scooters really shine. The vast majority of them produced today in the 150cc class and larger, are capable of highway speeds. In comparison
            to a typical motorcycle, they are slower, but in terms of practicality, they are head and shoulders above. Here's a quick comparison between a 150cc scooter,
            a 300cc scooter, a 400cc motorcycle, a Toyota Rav4, and the best selling vehicle in America from 2022, the Chevrolet Silverado,
            in terms of price, speed, and fuel economy.

            motorcycle, can be had for slightly less. So why the scooter?

        <!-- Paragraph for storage section -->
        <p>
            Picture this, you're on a motorcycle and you need to get to work, but you have a laptop, a lunch box, and several other things. You look around and there's no where 
            to put them. You use a backpack, but it's uncomfortable and stops the air from breathing through your jacket. You could get a tank bag, but it's not big enough for
            the laptop. Then, your partner calls you to pick up some groceries on the way home. What do you do? 
            <br><br> <!-- for getting into the scooter storage -->
            Well, if you had a scooter, you could have fit it all in the built-in underseat storage! Scooters typically have a large and roomy underseat storage area,
            watertight and lockable. They often can fit a full size helmet, sometimes two, with some room to spare! On top of this, they are typically ready to go for 
            mounting extra storage on the back, via a top case, also called a top box. These are often large enough to fit a full size backpack, and can be locked and 
            may even come with a passenger backrest built in as well!

            The scooter is just way more useful more of the time than a motorcycle. In many cases, you can use it instead of a car, it's cheaper to insure and run than 
            a motorcycle too.

        <br><br> <!-- create space so its looks nice and balanced to read -->
        <h2>"But, I can't get rid of my car!" - You don't need to. Really!</h2>
        <p>
            While the scooter is awesomely economical and a great way to move people to and from work and school (Trips where you don't typically need to haul a lot of people or
            equipment), it's not entirely feasible to get rid of your car in America. And that's okay. The scooter doesn't have to replace your vehicle outright, in fact,
            as the study states, only 10-25% of people would need to consider riding a scooter as an alternative way to simply commute to work and school for it to be supremely 
            beneficial for not only the rider, but for everyone else on the road. They get the fuel economy equal or better of most hybrid vehicles, 
            can store more than a motorcycle, are cheaper to insure, and their design protects you more from the wind and weather! Oh, and the step-through design and flat
            floorboards mean that almost anyone can hop on and ride, arthritic knees and all!
            <br><br> <!-- for readability -->
            But then what about the added costs? Is it actually cheaper to own? Well, let's take a look at some rough numbers. Let's say the average driver drives 15,000 miles
            per year. Let's also say that the average car gets 30 miles per gallon, and the average scooter gets 80 miles per gallon, and we're able to replace half the miles from
            the car with the scooter. Normally, you'd need 500 gallons per year with the car at 15,000 miles, and if gas were $4/gallon, that's $2000 per year. Replacing half of those miles,
            the scooter would need 94 gallons per year, costing roughly $376 per year. That's a savings of $624 per year in fuel. This number increases dramatically with lower fuel
            economy. If you were to drive the Silverado mentioned earlier, you would normally need 883 gallons of fuel. At $4/gallon, that's $3532 per year! Replacing half the miles,
            you'd spending $2142 per year, saving $1390 per year! But that's just the fuel costs. Running costs are also lower, as scooters have smaller tires, less oil, and less
            complicated powertrains. Then, there's the lower wear and tear on your car, which means less maintenance and repair costs. On top of that, the vehicle will experience 
            less depreciation, as it's gaining half the mileage it normally would. In 5 years, the car would normally have driven 75,000 miles, but with the scooter, 
            it would only have 37,500 miles. Your car will last longer, and be worth more if you decide to sell it. Both are big money savers, which easily offset the costs of 
            scooter ownership just from the vehicle depreciation alone! The scooter would pay for itself within a few years, and then you'd be saving money every year after that!
            <br><br> <!-- for readability -->
            Don't just take my word for it, I've done it myself! I use a 250cc scooter to do most of my daily A-to-B trips, It goes 75mph, gets 75mpg, and I bought it
            used, for $400. I still own my vehicle for getting things like cat litter and major grocery runs, or when I need to haul around
            some friends, but the rest of the time, I'm scooting around, saving money and having fun!
